Procedure (G):
  L ← Empty list that will contain the sorted elements
  S ← Set of all nodes with zero indegree
  while S is non-empty
    remove a node u from S
    L.add(u)
    for each adjacent node v of u
      remove edge(u,v) from the graph
        if v has no other incoming edges
          S.add(v)
        end if
     end for
  end while
  Return L
